# Built-Up Areas (2022) FAQ

## Who created the 2022 version of Built-Up Areas?
Ordnance Survey created [OS Open Built Up Areas](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/BuiltUpAreas "OS Open Built Up Areas Download Page") with the first version being published in December 2022 under Open Government Licensing (OGL). The Office for National Statistics and Scottish Government made significant contributions in the design of the dataset to ensure it is fit for purpose and focussed on the needs of the wider public sector.

## What is the difference between ‘OS Open Built Up Areas’ and ‘Built-Up Areas (2022)’?
Built-Up Areas (2022) is the name ONS are using for this product. This is to retain consistency with the naming of previous products like this that have been produced roughly every decade since the 1980s. The geometry and associated GSS codes of the two versions are identical. However, the format of the naming is different with ‘Built-Up Areas (2022)’ providing three name columns: BUA22NM, BUA22NMW and BUA22NMG. BUA22NM either contains the English name or the Welsh/Gaelic name where no alternative English name exists. BUA22NMW contains the Welsh name where an alternative English name exists. BUA22NMG contains the Gaelic name where an alternative English name exists. 2022 Built Up Areas also contains a centroid location for each area, provided in British National Grid Eastings and Northings and Latitude and Longitude.

## Are the 2022 Built-Up Areas the same geography as the 2011 Built-Up Areas?
The 2022 Built-Up Areas were created using a methodology based on the 2011 version. However, there are some notable differences that mean the 2022 Built Up Areas should be considered a new geography and not a continuation of the 2011 Built-Up Areas or 2011 Built-Up Area Subdivisions. This means statistics produced for areas with the same name are not directly comparable. Differences include:
  •	2022 Built-Up Areas were created using 25m by 25m cells. The 2011 version used 50m by 50m cells.
  •	2022 Built-Up Areas that are 200 metres or less away from each other have not been merged together to form a single area. The 2022 Built Up Areas are more similar to a layer created from 2011 Built-Up Area Subdivisions and 2011 Built-Up Areas that couldn’t be subdivided.

## Will a ‘merged’ version of 2022 Built Up Areas that joins nearby areas together, like the 2011 Built-Up Areas did, be produced?
Yes. This is planned for 2023 and will be called Built-Up Conglomerations.

## Why do only some 2022 Built-Up Areas have Welsh or Gaelic names?
We have only used the data contained in OS Open Built Up Areas to populate our name fields. If Ordnance Survey do not currently hold a Welsh or Gaelic name in their data used to assign names to areas then we can not currently include them.
